                      <p>Decisions about new product lines, generating (and/or maintaining) competitive advantages, potential new markets, and mitigating risks or seizing on opportunities (among others) all fall under the purview of the CEO. As with anything in an organization, they will rely on considerable data and input from senior leaders as well as direction and insight from the Board of Directors, but the CEO is the individual that has operational control over strategy and execution.</p>
